if the st-link is down (this can be indicated by LD1 led next to the 
usb port) LD1 will be solid red indicating the st-link is down

the reset button (black push button) is what i used to recover the
board along with an st-link utility

sudo apt-get install stlink-tools


normally plugging in the usb cable to the computer will have LD1 
blink red/green indicating the link is up

LD1 is solid red when it is down

holding the reset button when plugging in the USB will blink LD1

from there run `st-flash erase`

this erases the flash which is probably a factor that is halting
the st-link because an address is being accessed and modified 
when it should not

you should then be able to openocd your way into the board along
with gdb and load your program into memory
